## b.3 dimension
deviation vector
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(9,1,5,3,1,2), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
devivation <- x-matrix(c(1,1,1))%*%colMeans(x)
devivation

## c. length and cosine of deviation vectors
```{r}
length_1 <- sqrt(sum(devivation[,1]^2))
length_2 <- sqrt(sum(devivation[,2]^2))
length_1

```

R
```
Length of d1 =  5.656854, Length of d2 = 1.414214

We have cosin(d1,d2)=R12 with R is sample correlation coefficient so cosin(d1,d2) is: R12 = -0.5

# Question 2 (3.2)
## a. 2 dimension
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(3,4,6,-2,3,1), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
x
colMeans(x)
plot(x,pch=19,col=3,main = "Scatter plot in 2 dimensions",xlab="1",ylab="2")
points(4,1,col="red",pch=19)
```

## b.3dimension
```{r}
devivation <- x-matrix(c(1,1,1))%*%colMeans(x)

```

## c. length and cosine of deviation vectors

R
```
Length of d1 = 2.4494897, Length of d2 = 4.2426407

We have cosin(d1,d2)=R12 with R is sample correlation coefficient so cosin(d1,d2) is: R12 = -0.8660254

# Question 4 (3.4)
## a) projection
```{r}
library(MATH4793CHUAssignment)
T1_1$V1
T1_1$V1 - matrix(c(1,1,1,1,1,1))%*%colMeans(T1_1)
```

# Question 5 (3.5)
```{r}
x1 <- matrix(c(9,1,5,3,1,2), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
cov(x1)
det(cov(x1))
x2 <- matrix(c(3,4,6,-2,3,1), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
cov(x2)
det(cov(x2))
```


# Question 6 (3.6)
## a. deviation
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(-1,3,-2,2,4,2,5,2,3), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
x
deviation <- x - matrix(c(1,1,1))%*%colMeans(x)
deviation
a=deviation%*%matrix(c(1,1,-1),ncol = 1)
a
```
Since first column + second column = -third column, therefore those three column are not linear independent. In other words, the matrix is not full rank.

## b. S and generalized sample variance 
```{r}
# Sample Variance-Covariance Matrix S
S <- cov(x)
S
det(S)
```

The determine of S is close to 0 (consider as 0). This suggest that there is a least one dependent column in the data. In other words, the matrix is not full rank. The result is same as part a.

## c. total sample variance
```{r}
sum(diag(S))
```
# Question 7 (3.7)
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(5,4,4,5), nrow = 2, byrow=TRUE)
B <- matrix(c(5,-4,-4,5), nrow = 2, byrow=TRUE)
C <- matrix(c(3,0,0,3), nrow = 2, byrow=TRUE)
eigen(A)
acos(0.7071068)*(180/pi)
eigen(B)
acos(-0.7071068)*(180/pi)
eigen(C)
acos(0)*(180/pi)
```

# Question 8 (3.8)
```{r}
S1 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0,
               0, 1, 0,
               0, 0, 1), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

S2 <- matrix(c(1, -1/2, -1/2,
               -1/2, 1, -1/2,
               -1/2, -1/2, 1), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```
## a.toal sample variance
```{r}
variance1 <- sum(diag(S1))
variance2 <- sum(diag(S2))
variance1
variance2
```

S1 and S2 have the sample total sample variance

## b. generalize sample variance
```{r}
det(S1)
det(S2)
```
For S1, since its generalize sample variance = 1, it mean that the column are independent to each other.
For S2, since its generalize sample variance = 0, it mean that the column is not completely independence, at least one is dependent
