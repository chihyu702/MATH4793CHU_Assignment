## a) x1 and x2

Dependent! Since the covariance of x1 and x2 is -2, not 0 ($\sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21} = -2$), so x1 and x2 are dependent.

## b) x2 and x3

Independent! Since the covariance of x2 and x3 is 0 ($\sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} = 0$), so x2 and x3 are independent.

## c) (x1, x2) and x3

Independent! since the covariance of (x1, x2) and x3 is 0 ($\sigma_{13} = \sigma_{31} = \sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} = 0$), so (x1, x2) and x3 are independent

## d) (x1+x2)/2 and x3

## a) x1 and x2

Independent! Since the covariance of x1 and x2 is 0 ($\sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21} = 0$), so x1 and x2 are independent.

## b) x1 and x3

Dependent! Since the covariance of x1 and x3 is -1, not 0 ($\sigma_{13} = \sigma_{31} = -1$), so x1 and x3 are dependent.

## c) x2 and x3

Independent! Since the covariance of x2 and x3 is 0 ($\sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} = 0$), so x2 and x3 are independent.

## d) (x1, x3) and x2

Independent! since the covariance of (x1, x3) and x2 is 0 ($\sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21} = \sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} = 0$), so (x1, x3) and x2 are independent
