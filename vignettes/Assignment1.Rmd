# Question 1
```{r}

x2 <- c(5, 5.5, 4, 7, 10, 5, 7.5)

paste("the sample mean of x1 is:", round(mean(x1), 4) )
paste("the sample mean of x2 is:", round(mean(x2), 4) )
paste("the sample variance for x1 (s11) is:", round(var(x1), 4))
paste("the sample variance for x2 (s22) is:", round(var(x2), 4))
unbias_cov <- cov(x1,x2)
paste("the unbias covariance s12 is:", round(unbias_cov, 4) )
bias_cov<- cov(x2,x1)*(length(x1)-1) / length(x1)

# Question 2
```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
# data
age <- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11)
price <- c(18.95, 19.00, 17.95, 15.54, 14.00, 12.95, 8.94, 7.49, 6.00, 3.99)
data <- data.frame(Age = age, Price = price)

layout(matrix(c(0, 2, 3, 1), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE), widths = c(1, 4), heights = c(1, 4))
# scatter plot
par(mar = c(5, 4, 2, 2))
plot(data$Age, data$Price, main = "Price vs Age",
     xlab = "Age (Years)", ylab = "Price (Thousands of dollars)", pch = 19)
# Age Marginal dot diagram
par(mar = c(2, 4, 2, 2) )
unique_ages <- unique(data$Age)
counts <- table(data$Age)
plot(unique_ages, counts,  xlim = c(0, max(unique_ages)), ylim = c(0, max(counts)),
      ylab = "count", xlab = "", 
     main = "Age")
# Price Marginal dot diagram
par(mar = c(5, 2, 2, 2))
unique_price <- unique(data$Price)
plot(rep(1.0, length(data$Price)) , data$Price, 
     ylim = c(min(data$Price), max(data$Price)), xlim = c(0,2),
      ylab = "", xlab = "count", main = "Price")
```

According to the plot, two variables, age and price have the negative relationship. This indicates that the sample covariance is negative.

```{r}
paste("the sample mean for age (x1) is:", mean(age))
paste("the sample mean for price (x2) is:", mean(price))
paste("the sample variance for age (s11) is:", round(var(age),4) )
bias_age <- var(age)*(length(age)-1)/length(age)
paste("the sample bias variance for age (s11) is:", round(bias_age,4) )
paste("the sample variance for price (s22) is:", round(var(price), 4) ) 
bias_price <- var(price)*(length(price)-1)/length(price)
paste("the sample bias variance for price (s22) is:", round(bias_price, 4) ) 
paste("the sample unbais covariance (s12) is:", round(cov(age, price), 4) )
biasap <- cov(age, price)*(length(price)-1)/length(price)
paste("the sample bais covariance (s12) is:", round(biasap, 4) )
paste("the sample correlation coefficient (r12) is:", round(cor(age, price), 4) )
```
According to the covariance and the correlation coefficient, those negative sign indicates the negative relation between age and price. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient is -0.9783, close to -1, meaning this is a strong linear negative relationship. Thus, this means an increase in age would cause the price decrease quite consistently.

# Question 4
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
# data
sales<- c(108.28, 152.36, 95.04, 65.45, 62.97, 263.99, 265.19, 285.06, 92.01, 165.68) #x1, sales in billions
profits <- c(17.05, 16.59, 10.91, 14.14, 9.52, 25.33, 18.54, 15.73, 8.10, 11.13) #x2, profits in billions
# scatter plot for x1 and x2
layout(matrix(c(2, 0, 1,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE), widths = c(4, 1), heights = c(1, 4))
par(mar = c(5, 4, 2, 2))
plot(sales, profits, main="Profit vs Sales", 
     xlab="Sales (billions)", ylab="Profits (billions)", pch=19)
# Sales Marginal dot diagram
par(mar = c(2, 4, 1, 2) )
plot( sales, rep(1,length(sales)), 
      xlim = c(min(sales), max(sales)),ylim = c(0,2), main = "Sales",
      ylab = "count", xlab = "")
# Profit Marginal dot diagram
par(mar = c(5, 0, 2, 2))
plot(rep(1, length(profits)) , profits, 
     ylim = c(min(profits), max(profits)), xlim = c(0,2), main = "Profits",
     ylab = "", xlab = "count")
```
The diagram does not show the perfect linear relationship, but it appears to be a positive relationship between sales and profits.

```{r}
paste("the sales mean is:", round(mean(sales), 4) )
paste("the profits mean is:", round(mean(profits), 4) )
paste("the sales variance is:", round(var(sales), 4))
paste("the profits variance is:", round(var(profits), 4))
paste("the unbias covariance between sales and profits is:", round(cov(sales, profits), 4) )
paste("the correlation coefficient between sales and profits is:", round(cor(sales, profits), 4) )
```
The correlation coefficient between sales and profits is 0.6861, which indicates that it is a positive relationship. However, it is not a strong linear relationship as the absolution is not close to 1.
